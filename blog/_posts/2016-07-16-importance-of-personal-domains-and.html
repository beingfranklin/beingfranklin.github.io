They gives a boost to the marketing and branding sector. Many of us would already be knowing it. For those who don't, Its time to rethink. <br /><br />When we observe&nbsp; the trends in the blogosphere,we see that giving your blog your name as domain name increases the popularity and helps in Personal branding. Its easy to remember names rather than boring blog titles.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />People can fill them with their random blog posts and sometimes they can be even used as an online portfolio .<strong>By doing so you present yourself as a brand to the people out there.</strong>  <br /><strong></strong>&nbsp; <br />Many Pros often do keep separate blogs , so as to differentiate themselves from the others. Like John Saddington's <em>john.do</em> ,chris coyier's <em>chriscoyier.com , </em>Amit Agarwal's<em> amitagarwal.com ..</em> and the list goes on.  <br />&nbsp; <br /><h2>Why should I do it ? What happens if I don't ?</h2>Its simple. <sub></sub><sub></sub>You don't lose anything. But you may lose the chance to brand yourself as some Pro’s do. The trends are changing and people are nowadays just exchanging their domain names instead of their business cards .<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EAIjcK53dDE/V4qPOu1i8lI/AAAAAAAACEA/jXcs3IYncqUHm9yLNjiYoDq7Xp8Zk15ZQCLcB/s1600/5215530121_d2edc85df1_b.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img alt="Personal Domain And Personal Branding chances" border="0" height="427" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EAIjcK53dDE/V4qPOu1i8lI/AAAAAAAACEA/jXcs3IYncqUHm9yLNjiYoDq7Xp8Zk15ZQCLcB/s640/5215530121_d2edc85df1_b.jpg" title="Personal Domain And Personal Branding Chances" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Stand Out !!.Narrow your Chances.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />You lose all the Advantages listed below.<br /><ul><li><strong>Standing Out from the Crowd</strong>.It helps you to show people how different and cool you are and as I mentioned above, it comes handy during business conversations.  </li><li><strong>Its the same Always . </strong>Whenever the trend changes you don't have to change your domain name as your domain name stays same as long as your name stays.  </li><li><strong>Gives an Idea and Unique Identity about you in the Web. </strong>As I mentioned above, uniqueness is the key factor that differentiates ourselves from others  </li><li><strong>Personal Email and other personal sub-domains. </strong>You get a bulk of of sub domains and email id’s (as per your hosting provider’s conditions).
