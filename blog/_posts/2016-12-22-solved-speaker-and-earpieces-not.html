<p>I had experienced an unusual problem/bug in my Sony Xperia Z. It was one of the craziest thing I had experienced.</p><p>The Bug was</p><ul><li>Media Files Didn't have Audio Input</li><li>Earpieces got disabled/didnt work during phone calls. Each time I had to connect to an earpiece or put it in Loudspeaker to&nbsp; continue with the phone calls.</li><li>The Videos Recorded didnt have an audio… etc</li></ul><a name='more'></a><br clear="all"><p>I was sure that it wasn’t a hardware issue because during diagnostics it all seemed working perfectly. </p><p><br></p><p>I sat browsing and posting about this bug for about 3 months ,but sadly I couldn’t find proper answers.</p><p>All of them pointed to few common solutions</p><ul><li>Hard Reset</li><li>Uninstalling Recently Installed Apps</li><li>Rooting Your Phone .. etc</li></ul><p>I had done the first two ,but couldnt do the latter one<em> (As my phone’s Bootloader was Locked it was risky to do and it may even lead to Brick</em>). </p><p><br></p><h2>How I Solved it?</h2><p>I installed few Apps. But this Particular App was the which really helped me out – <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woodslink.android.wiredheadphoneroutingfix&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">SoundAbout</a></strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nsS7rkPoPKY/WFwmNC9eRbI/AAAAAAAACNI/kJKZitzNhLo/s1600-h/download%25255B4%25255D.jpg"><img width="145" height="145" title="download" style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; width: 19.22%; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="download" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bUo9KacjMlo/WFwmOQm3-DI/AAAAAAAACNM/HEUMSIRaWFk/download_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" border="0"></a></p><p><br></p><p>You just need to install the App from Appstore and choose what you have to enable what you don’t.Do take special care while doing this and you can change whenever you want. </p><p><br></p><p>Voila!!You are done.Things are going smooth and till I Post this Blog Post.</p><p><br></p><h5>Drawback</h5><p>You have to select each operation for each function(Headset for music,Earpiece for Calling etc..) till you get a proper update from Sony. Since Sony Mobiles have stoppped their support for this model , I think we have to go with this patchwork. <img width="19" height="19" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-sadsmile" style="width: 1.84%;" alt="Sad smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zb7CuJBgje8/WFwlsa7WsEI/AAAAAAAACNE/0nk4cCCVUIQ/wlEmoticon-sadsmile%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800"></p>
